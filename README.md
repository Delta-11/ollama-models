# DeepSeek Chat API - Python Package

## Introduction

The **DeepSeek Chat** Python package provides an interface to the DeepSeek chat completion model. This tool allows users to interact with the DeepSeek API within a Python environment, enabling natural language queries and responses.

## Features

### Query Processing
- Execute complex text queries for information retrieval
- Process multiple lines of query input incrementally
- Handle various response formats (text, JSON, etc.)

### Response Handling
- Provide system prompt output on request
- Generate detailed explanations and context
- Offer flexible confidence scores for responses

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   pip install dsPyversion.py
   ```

2. **Basic Usage**
   ```python
   # Initialize the model
   import os

   model_path = 'deepseek-r1:7b'
   api_key = ''  # You may need to handle API key properly later

   dspy.configure(dspy.LM(model_path, api_base='http://localhost:11434', api_key=api_key))

   # Perform a query
   response = dspy.query("How many number of R is there in word Strawberry?")
   print(response)
   ```

## Roadmap

| Version | Features & Changes |
|--------|--------------------|
| 0.1.0   | Basic functionality for querying text, with initial API integration. |
| 0.2.0   | Enhanced response handling with confidence scores and system prompts. |
| 0.3.0   | Added chain-based interactions for more complex queries. |

## Compatibility

Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements (e.g., Python 3.x, installed dependencies). Any issues should be reported through the GitHub repository.

## Notes
- **API Key Handling**: Ensure proper authentication with a valid API key.
- **Performance**: This is a basic implementation. Consider additional optimizations for specific use cases.
- **Future Enhancements**: Explore adding more response formats and interactive features for future versions.
